# ee357final-project

The program took 32-bit instructions, decoded them and executed their instruction. The PC, memory, and registers were emulated on a COLDFIRE processor. We used codeWarrior as our IDE. My role in this project was to implement BE, BNE, READS, DISP, and END. BE and BNE were a little tricky because of the fact that we could backtrack to ta previous instruction. So to implement this I had to check if the value that increments the PC was positive or negative. In any case, if the instruction did branch I would just need to add the fetched immediate value in the 32-bit instruction to the emulated PC. The READS and DISP instructions involved initializing both the LEDs and dip-switches, this was simple because we did this in previous labs. To read I had to move a value from a specific address, to display, I had to move a value to a specific address. This turned out to be very easy to implement although I had a small issue when I tried to initialize the dip-switches before the LEDs. To fix this unknown issue if just reversed the order of initialization. In addition to my own part, I of course had a role in debugging and testing the entire project after all the emulated instructions were implemented.
